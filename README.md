# Safe Safar
Safe Safar is an Android application that displays potential risks on the road like manholes that lead to accidents and deaths of people in the rainy season.
This application allows users to submit image of the manhole when present at the location of it that later gets updated in the database and gets displayed on a map. This map displays potential risks on the map so that people can locate the manholes and reduce their risk of falling into them.
